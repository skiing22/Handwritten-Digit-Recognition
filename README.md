# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
A neural network-based handwritten digit recognition system implemented in Python using TensorFlow.
# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Network  

This project implements a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset**.  

## Features  
- **Model Architecture:**  
  - 1 hidden layer with 100 units.  
  - Activation functions: ReLU and softmax.  
- **Technologies Used:**  
  - Python, TensorFlow.  
- **Key Techniques:**  
  - Data preprocessing.  
  - Feedforward and backpropagation.  
  - Regularization (lambda = 0.1).  
  - Optimizer with 70 iterations.
